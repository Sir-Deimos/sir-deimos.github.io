            <h2>Rules & Classes</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                Autocross is a type of motorsport where drivers race through a course marked by traffic cones. The goal is to complete the course in the fastest time without hitting any cones or going off course. Below are the official rules and class definitions for WKY Autocross events.
            </p>

            <h3>General Rules</h3>
            <p><strong>Entry Fees:</strong> $50 to race | $5 to spectate | $10 to ride</p>
            <ul class="rules-list">
                <li>All vehicles entered into events must be domestic or import, four-wheeled vehicles that are licensed for regular street use.</li>
                <li>Gasoline, E-85, diesel fuel, bio-diesel, hydrogen, and electricity are the only fuel/power sources to be used in vehicles entered in the events. Nitrous oxide, alcohol, and nitro methane are prohibited.</li>
                <li>All entrants/drivers must have a current and valid government-issued driver’s license and must be at least 16 years of age. All drivers under the age of 18 must have a parent/legal guardian waiver signed during registration.</li>
                <li>Participating cars must pass a technical inspection that will emphasize safety. (Battery must be tied down, wheel bearings, wheels, tires, etc. must be in good working order)</li>
                <li>Helmet use is required - helmets must have a SNELL rating SA2015 or newer. M or DOT rated helmets may be allowed at event organizers' discretion.</li>
                <li><strong>Tires:</strong> Participants in all classes must use DOT-approved, non-competition, treaded (non-grooved) street tires (no competition radials, no R compound, drag radials) with a treadwear rating of 200 or higher. Tires will be required to pass a technical inspection. Any modifications or chemical treatments to tires will be unacceptable. Competitors with tires showing any evidence of modification will be immediately disqualified from the event. Safety is of the utmost importance, and officials will not hesitate to disqualify questionable tire selections.</li>
                <li><strong>AERO:</strong> Splitters, spoilers, wings, and canards are open.</li>
                <li>Seatbelts or safety harnesses must be properly installed; lap-belts only will be allowed providing they are mounted in the original factory location.</li>
                <li>The official time for each run will be as measured by the automatic timer plus any penalties incurred.</li>
                <li>A two-second penalty will be imposed for knocking a pylon over or out of its outlined box. If the pylon is left standing and touching any part of its outlined box, it is not a penalty. Pointer or "lay down" cones are considered directional aids and do not impose a penalty.</li>
                <li>Burnouts, excessive speed, or any other dumb stuff on property or in the grid/staging area is strictly prohibited and will result in a penalty or dismissal from the event.</li>
                <li>No open-toe shoes or sandals/flip flops allowed on course.</li>
                <li>Spectators will have a designated area.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Classes</h3>
            <ul class="classes-list">
                <li><strong>Modern:</strong> 1990 and newer 4-seat coupes and sedans (Mustang, Camaro, Charger, Cadillac, BMW, V8+ Engine Swaps, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Vintage:</strong> 1989 and older 4-seat coupes and sedans, including C1-C3 Corvettes and AMX (V8+ engine swaps)</li>
                <li><strong>Super:</strong> Unlimited sports car (C4-C8 Corvette, Any AWD, any 3 rotor, and all modern mid and rear-engine vehicles)</li>
                <li><strong>Sport Compact:</strong> Sport compact vehicles (4/6 cylinder or 2 rotor, 4/6 cylinder AWD NA only)</li>
                <li><strong>Truck:</strong> Front engine, SRWD (single rear wheel drive) or AWD truck/SUV/van vehicles with a minimum weight of 2900 pounds built on a truck chassis and marketed as truck/SUV/van from the factory (example - Chevy C or S series, Ford F series, Trailblazer, Explorer, etc.) Eligible vehicles must be factory height or lower. Trucks must have at least 50% bed floor coverage including wheel wells that cover the tires, and a tail gate or other solid rear panel. Bed floor must be the entire width of the bed and does not include wheel well measurements. It is measured front to rear, not in square footage. Example - an 8’ bed must have at least 48” of bed floor the entire width of the bed not including the wheel wells. Bed floor can be stock, aftermarket, or fabricated. For safety, bed covers must be of a rigid material and require an integral connection to the truck bed, or they must be removed prior to entering the event.</li>
                <li><strong>Outlaw:</strong> Unlimited. This class is for all vehicles that don’t fit into the above classes, lightweight cars, and kit cars. Lightweight, heavy mods, this is for you. Must follow posted tire rules. This Class will be treated as a "Pro" class for our faster competitors to be isolated together.</li>
            </ul>
